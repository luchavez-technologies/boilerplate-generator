# Replace `elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the bucket that AWS created
# when you created your first Elastic Beanstalk environment.

# Make sure that the IAM Role for the EC2 Instance set in the Elastic Beanstalk configuration
# has attached the `AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk` policy.

#  AWSEBAutoScalingGroup:
