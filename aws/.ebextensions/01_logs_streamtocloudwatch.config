# The following file installs and configures the AWS CloudWatch Logs agent
# to push the /var/app/current/storage/logs/laravel.log file to a Log Group in CloudWatch Logs.

# You can then see the CloudWatch Logs by accessing the AWS CloudWatch Console and clicking
# the "Logs" link on the left. The Log Group name will follow this format:
# /aws/elasticbeanstalk/<environment name>/<full log name path>

## For more information about "Log Streaming" feature, see:
## http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.cloudwatchlogs.html

## This file was templated based on the following example:
## https://github.com/awsdocs/elastic-beanstalk-samples/blob/master/configuration-files/aws-provided/instance-configuration/logs-streamtocloudwatch-linux.config

# Usually, the option_settings with enabled Stream Logs should be uncommented if you are not using IaaC, like Chef or Terraform.
# If you created the environment manually, uncomment the following lines and set the amount of retention in days.

# option_settings:
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: StreamLogs
#     value: true
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: DeleteOnTerminate
#     value: false
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: RetentionInDays
#     value: 7
